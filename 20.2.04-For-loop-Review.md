20.2.04-For-loop-Review
```

1. Write an app that draws **21 lines** in the given pattern. You must use 1 **loop with 21 iterations**, and within the loop, only make **one call to `line()`**. Every other `for` loop you do must refference the length of your array. 

2. Additionally, the app should include **buttons** to allow the user to dynamically change both the **line colors** and the **line widths**. Store the colors in an **array** instead of hardcoding them. Clicking the buttons will alter the color and width of the lines based on user interaction.

3. Add one extra line of functionality to this of your choice.

You will be marked on functionality and code clarity. 

### Hints

 - Store the colors (`red`, `blue`, `green`, and `black`) in an array, and use a loop to access them when creating the buttons and changing line colors.
-  Use `circle()` for your buttons and make a `colisions()` function with `dist()` to return true or false.
-  In your mouse pressed use a `for` loop to help with hit box checking. You only need 1 `for` loop. 


```js
// Array to store button colors
let lineColors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black'];
let strokechange = [6,8,10,12]
let selectedColour = "red" //use this for your fill()
let lineWidth = 1;
// Function to get button color based on parameters


function setup() {
  
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}//end setup

function draw() {
  background(255);
 
  fill(0); // Black text
  textSize(20);
  textStyle(BOLD);
  textAlign(CENTER);
  text('21 Lines', 200, 30);
  
  textSize(12);
  textStyle(NORMAL);
  text('Color buttons change the line colors', 200, 50);
  text('Width buttons change the line widths', 200, 70);
  //noStroke();
  fill(0); // Black text
  textAlign(RIGHT);
  text('Colors:', 50, 335);

  
}//end of draw

function mousePressed() {
  
  
}//end mousePressed
```
