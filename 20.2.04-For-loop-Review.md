20.2.04-For-loop-Review
```

Write an app that draws **21 lines** in the given pattern. You must use a **loop with 21 iterations**, and within the loop, only make **one call to `line()`**.

Additionally, the app should include **buttons** to allow the user to dynamically change both the **line colors** and the **line widths**. Store the colors in an **array** instead of hardcoding them. Clicking the buttons will alter the color and width of the lines based on user interaction.

### Hints

 - Store the colors (`red`, `blue`, `green`, and `black`) in an array, and use a loop to access them when creating the buttons and changing line colors.
-  Use `circle()` for your buttons and make a `colisions()` function with `dist()` to return true or false. 


```js
// Array to store button colors
let colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black'];

// Function to get button color based on parameters


function setup() {
  
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}//end setup

function draw() {
  background(255);



  
}//end of draw

function mousePressed() {
  
  
}//end mousePressed
```
