## **Introduction**  
In this challenge, you’ll strengthen your skills with **arrays and loops** while managing fundraising data. You'll also practice using **conditional logic (`IF` statements)** and **randomization** in JavaScript. Your goal is to track and analyze fundraising efforts while ensuring your team qualifies for the celebration event.  

---

## **Step 0 - Setting Up Your Data (20%)**  
1. Create **three parallel arrays** for **10 students**:  
   - **Names**: Include yourself as the **9th person** in the list.  
   - **Total funds raised**: Assign each student a **different amount** between **$0 and $500**.  
     - Ensure at least **some students raised less than $40** (this will be used in Step 2).  
   - **Permission forms**: A boolean array (`true/false`) indicating whether each student has returned their permission form.  
     - For **testing/marking**, set **half** to `true` and the other half to `false`.  
     - *Tip*: Use lowercase `true` and `false` without quotes:  
       ```javascript
       let forms = [false, true, true, ...];
       ```  

---

## **Step 1 - Display Fundraising Data (No Extra Marks, But Required)**  
Write a **single `for` loop** to display all three arrays on the canvas.  
Each student’s **name**, **donation total**, and **permission status (`true/false`)** should be shown side by side.  

### **Example Output:**  
```
Alex - $125 - true  
Sam - $35 - false  
Jamie - $210 - true  
...  
```

---

## **Step 2 - Analyzing Fundraising Progress (60%)**  
Create separate `for` loops for each task below. Run them inside `draw()` and display each result with clear labels.  
- your might need to use a flag variable to avoide the infinate money glitch. 
- each function needs to have a return value.
   - You are not allowed to print to show the answer
   - each of these functions are math based, no drawing in them

### **1. TOTAL and AVERAGE Donations (20%)**  
- Calculate and display:  
  - The **total amount raised** by the team.  
  - The **average amount raised** per student.  

### **Example Output in draw:**  
```
Total raised: $2150  
Average raised per student: $215  
```

---

### **2. COUNTIF - Bottle Drive Check (20%)**  
Each function in here must have a reutrn value.  Because this is math based funciton you are not allowed to draw or use text in here.

- Students must raise **at least $40** to attend the party.  
- Count how many students **raised less than $40** and display that number.  
- If **2 or fewer** students fall below this threshold, display:  
  `"Bottle Drive NOT required"`  
- If **more than 2** students are below $40, display:  
   `"Bottle Drive is this Saturday"`  

### **Example Output in draw:**  
```
Students below $40: 3  
Bottle Drive is this Saturday  
```

---

### **3. HIGHEST Fundraiser (20%)**  
Each function in here must have a reutrn value.  Because this is math based funciton you are not allowed to draw or use text in here.

- Find and display:  
  - The **highest amount raised**.  
  - The **name of the student** who raised it.  

### **Example Output in draw:**  
```
Our highest fundraiser was Jamie, who raised $490.  
```

---

## **Step 3 - Final 20%**  
Each function in here must have a reutrn value.  Because this is math based funciton you are not allowed to draw or use text in here.

### **4. SUMIF - Eligible Funds Raised (10%)**  
- Only students who **submitted their permission forms** can attend the event.  
- Use a **SUMIF** algorithm to total the donations **only from students who have turned in their forms**.  

### **Example Output in draw:**  
```
Fees raised by those with permission to attend: $1250  
```
  - *Hint*: make your own **SUMIF** algorithm works like a total algorithm but includes an `if` condition inside the loop.

---

### **5. DOOR PRIZE - Random Winner (10%)**  
Each function in here must have a reutrn value.  Because this is math based funciton you are not allowed to draw or use text in here.

- Every time the **mouse is clicked**, randomly select a **team member’s name** and display it as the door prize winner.  
- The **same person may win multiple times**, as the selection is random.  

### **Example Output in draw:**  
```
[mouse is clicked] This door prize goes to: Alex  
[mouse is clicked] This door prize goes to: Sam  
[mouse is clicked] This door prize goes to: Jamie  
```
- *Hints*:  
  1. **No `for` loop needed**—this takes at most **2 lines** of code:  
     - One line to generate a **random number**.  
     - One line to **display the name**.  
  2. Use **`floor(random(0,10))`** to generate a number between **0 and 9** (for indexing into the name array).
